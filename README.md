# tree-sitter-curse

Tree-sitter grammar for [curse-lang](https://github.com/QnnOkabayashi/curse-lang) designed for use with Neovim, but should work with anything that uses tree-sitter.

You should be able to install this like any neovim plugin, and then will be able to `TSInstall curse` to install and build the parser.
